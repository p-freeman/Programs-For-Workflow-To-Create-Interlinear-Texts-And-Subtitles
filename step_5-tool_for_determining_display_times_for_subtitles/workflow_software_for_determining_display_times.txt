Workflow with software for determining display times for subtitles:

1. Open tool_for_determining_display_times_v4-(step_b).html in your browser.

2. Load the video file (or audio file).

3. Play the video and press Enter at the desired times—the times will be written to the textarea-field.

4. Download: Save the timestamps.txt file.

5. timestamps.txt contains one time per line—you can then link this to the group file (from the program "group_words_gui.py").
